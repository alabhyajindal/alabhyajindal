## Hello! I'm Alabhya 👋

👨‍💻 I work at [Maya Labs](https://mayalabs.io/) as a Frontend Engineer.  
🔧 I enjoy creating new things - like my recent Chrome Extension, [Search Select](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-select/ijpalmkmpikekpglgjacfnaecdidhmgn).  
✍️ I love reading and writing. I am currently reading [Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/books/getting-real).  
📖 I am always learning. Right now I am going through Eloquent JavaScript to improve my JS skills. You can view my progress [here](https://github.com/alabhyajindal/eloquent). 

Next.js, Supabase and Tailwind CSS are some of my favorite technologies. Say hi on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alabhyajindal)!
