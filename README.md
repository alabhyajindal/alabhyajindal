## Hello! I'm Alabhya 👋

I enjoy working with JavaScript. I'm currently working on [Visits](https://visits.vercel.app/), which is a platform to connect companies offering industrial visits with students seeking them.

🔧 I enjoy creating new things - like my recent Chrome Extension, [Search Select](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-select/ijpalmkmpikekpglgjacfnaecdidhmgn).  
✍️ I love reading and writing. I am currently reading Mastery by Robert Greene. You can check out my blog [here](https://alabhyajindal.com/).  
📖 I am always learning. Right now I am going through Eloquent JavaScript to improve my JS skills. You can view my progress [here](https://github.com/alabhyajindal/eloquent). 

Next.js, Supabase and Tailwind CSS are some of my favorite technologies. The best place to connect with me is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alabhyajindal), [say hi](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1544983692&text=Hi%20Alabhya!)!
